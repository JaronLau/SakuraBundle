# Project overview
    The project name is same as our team name, Sakura Bundle
    The aim of the website we are making is to sell flowers from Japan, or other household objects that
    have the theme of flowers, for people who are not so invested in taking the time to buy and nuture flowers. Our motto is
    “Find yourself something to smile upon, and it will return in kind.” Our team hopes users will find a flower or household object to purchase
    that they can take care of, and return their compassion will return them with good fortune and warmth.
    It is made to have all of it's features be easy to understand, enjoyable gameplay, and rewards to encourage users to come
    back and continue to use our services.
